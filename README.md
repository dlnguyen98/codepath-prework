    The app I would like to build is a loyalty rewards and customer 
    check-in app for small businesses. The app would ask a phone number
    for a customer to check-in. The customer would then earn points
    for checking in. The points could then be used for future discounts
    or rewards. The app would also send a discount or reward to customers
    on their birthday or if they haven't checked in for a while.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
